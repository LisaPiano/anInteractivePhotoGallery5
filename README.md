# anInteractivePhotoGallery5
 Create an Interactive Gallery using HTML, CSS and JS
This is the fifth project for the Team Treehouse Front End Tech Degree. Through the combination of HTML, CSS and JS, I will create a photo gallery using CSS Grid, and photos that are already supplied to me. I will either code a JS searchFilter, or use the one already supplied.
